				"content_html": "<p>A few days ago, I found myself strolling through the bustling streets of the Gold Coast, basking in the sun-kissed ambiance of this coastal paradise. Little did I know, my leisurely escapade was about to take a frustrating turn. You see, I had recently acquired a brand-new phone, and like any responsible gadget owner, I decided it was time to safeguard its pristine screen with a protector.With this mission in mind, I ventured into a local phone shop in the mall, confident that I would soon be walking out with my phone&rsquo;s screen securely shielded.</p>\n<p>The shop assistant recommended an UV-cured tempered screen protector, assuring me of its superior protection and durability. The price tag? A steep fifty dollars. But, believing in the adage &ldquo;you get what you pay for,&rdquo; I agreed.</p>\n<p>The process seemed straightforward enough, until the assistant decided to give my phone&rsquo;s S Pen a similar UV treatment. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t think much of it. However, this decision would soon come back to haunt me. In the days that followed, I noticed the paint on the S Pen starting to peel off, as if the UV liquid had waged war against the plastic, leaving it battered and bruised.</p>\n<p>But the ordeal didn&rsquo;t end there. To my dismay, I soon discovered that the edges of the screen protector were already showing signs of wear and tear, with small chips appearing like unwelcome guests at a party. And let&rsquo;s not forget the S Pen, which had transformed from a sleek accessory to a half-broken tool, its button now stubbornly resistant to my clicks.Here I am, barely two weeks into owning my new phone, and I&rsquo;m already dealing with a chipped screen protector and a compromised S Pen.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a stark reminder that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry. As I reflect on this experience, I can&rsquo;t help but feel a mix of frustration and resignation. After all, it&rsquo;s just one of those things that happen, right?

				"title": "The Never-Ending Struggle of Connecting an External Monitor to a Linux Laptop with a Dedicated Nvidia GPU",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>As a Linux user, I was excited to upgrade my laptop to a new model with a dedicated Nvidia GPU. However, I soon discovered that using an external monitor with DisplayPort (DP) was a nightmare. While HDMI connected via the laptop's integrated GPU worked out of the box with minor adjustments, the DP simply refused to work correctly. I spent countless hours trying to debug the issue and make it work, but all my attempts failed.</p><p>Firstly, I checked the hardware and ensured the DP cable and the monitor were functioning properly. I also tried connecting the laptop to different monitors, but the problem persisted. Next, I checked the Nvidia drivers and ensured they were installed and updated. However, the DP still did not work even after updating the drivers.</p><p>I then dug deeper into the issue and found that the problem was how Nvidia GPUs handled DP. I discovered that the Nvidia GPU was not powering on the DP output when the laptop booted up, which caused the external monitor not to detect any signal. This issue was not unique to my laptop, and many other Linux users had reported the same problem with Nvidia GPUs and DP.</p><p>After researching the issue, I found that some workarounds involved using external adapters or modifying the <code>xorg.conf</code> file. However, these solutions were not ideal as they often resulted in other issues, such as screen flickering or compatibility issues like waking up from suspend/hibernate. Furthermore, using an external adapter defeated the purpose of having a DP port on the laptop in the first place.</p><p>Eventually, I decided to ditch the DP for the time being and stick with using HDMI via the laptop's integrated GPU. While it was not ideal, it was a reliable solution that worked without glitches or issues. However, I continued to keep an eye on the issue and hoped that a proper fix would be available in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, using an external monitor with DP on Linux laptops with dedicated Nvidia GPUs can be a nightmare. Despite numerous attempts to debug the issue, I could not make it work without experiencing glitches or issues. While workarounds such as using external adapters or modifying configuration files may work for some users, they were not suitable solutions for me. Ultimately, I decided to ditch the DP and use HDMI instead.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Let your linux have dynamic wallpaper just like Apple did to their macOS.</p><p>Dynamic wallpapers are a great way to personalize your desktop and add some variety to your computer experience. Pywal is a popular tool that allows you to generate colour schemes based on the wallpaper you're using. However, if you want to take it a step further and have a dynamic wallpaper that changes throughout the day, you can use dwall, a tool built on top of Pywal that changes your wallpaper and colour scheme based on the time of day.</p><p>Dwall is a dynamic wallpaper manager for Linux that integrates with pywal. Dwall allows you to use multiple wallpapers that change automatically based on various factors. In this article, we will learn how to set up dynamic wallpaper using pywal and dwall.</p><p>Here's how you can set up dwall on your Linux system:</p><h2 id=\"install-pywal-and-feh\">Install Pywal and feh:</h2><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ sudo apt-get install python3-pywal feh</code></pre><h2 id=\"clone-the-dwall-repository\">Clone the dwall repository:</h2><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ git clone https://github.com/mczachurski/dynamic-wallpaper.git</code></pre><p>Go into the <code>dynamic-wallpaper</code> directory and run the <code>install.sh</code> script:</p><h2 id=\"install-dwall\">Install dwall</h2><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cd dynamic-wallpaper \n$ ./install.sh</code></pre><p>This will install dwall and set it up to run as a systemd service. You can customize the wallpapers and colour schemes that dwall uses by editing the <code>config.ini</code> file in the <code>dynamic-wallpaper</code> directory.</p><h2 id=\"setup-crontab-job\">Setup crontab job</h2><p>Once dwall is installed, you need to set up a cron job to run the script every minute. Open your crontab file by running the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ crontab -e</code></pre><p>If this is your first time running <code>crontab</code>, you will be prompted to select an editor.</p><ol><li>Add the following line to the crontab file:</li></ol><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">* * * * * env TERM=xterm DISPLAY=:0 DESKTOP_SESSION=&lt;your desktop session&gt; DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=&lt;your dbus address&gt; /path/to/dwall -s &lt;theme&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Replace <code>/path/to/dynamic-wallpaper</code> with the path to the directory where you cloned the dwall repository.</p><p>This command sets the necessary environment variables (<code>TERM</code>, <code>DISPLAY</code>, <code>DESKTOP_SESSION</code>, and <code>DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS</code>) and runs the <code>dwall.py</code> script every minute.</p><p>This will ensure that dwall starts running automatically every time you log in to your system.</p><p>Save and close the crontab file.</p><p>That's it! You should now have a dynamic wallpaper that changes throughout the day based on the time of day. You can browse all the available themes on the project's <a href=\"https://github.com/adi1090x/dynamic-wallpaper\">GitHub</a> page.</p>\n",

				"title": "Deploy Redis On Kubernetes Using StatefulSet",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration tool that can be used to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. One of the many benefits of Kubernetes is its ability to deploy StatefulSets, which are designed to manage stateful applications, such as databases, in a way that ensures data consistency and availability. In this article, we will explore how to deploy Redis on Kubernetes using a StatefulSet.</p><h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2><p>Before we dive into the deployment process, there are a few prerequisites that need to be in place. First, you need to have a working Kubernetes cluster. If you don't have one setup already, there are several options available for setting up a Kubernetes cluster, including using a managed Kubernetes service such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).</p><p>Once you have your Kubernetes cluster set up, you will need to have the <code>kubectl</code> command-line tool installed on your local machine. Kubectl is the primary tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters and is used to deploy and manage Kubernetes resources.</p><p>Lastly, you will need a Redis container image. You can either use an existing Redis image available on Docker Hub, or you can build your own image if you have specific requirements.</p><h2 id=\"deploying-redis-on-kubernetes\">Deploying Redis on Kubernetes</h2><p>Now that we have our prerequisites in place let's get started with deploying Redis on Kubernetes using a StatefulSet.</p><h3 id=\"step-1-create-a-redis-configuration-file\">Step 1: Create a Redis Configuration File</h3><p>Before deploying Redis using StatefulSet, we need to create a Redis configuration file. This file will contain the configuration parameters that Redis needs to run.</p><pre><code class=\"language-conf\">bind 0.0.0.0\nprotected-mode no\n</code></pre><p>This configuration file sets Redis to bind to all network interfaces and disables the protected mode.</p><h2 id=\"step2-create-a-redis-docker-image\">Step2: Create a Redis Docker Image</h2><p>Now that we have our Redis configuration file, it's time to create a Docker image that includes the configuration file. We'll use a Dockerfile to build the image.</p><p>Create a file named Dockerfile with the following contents:</p><pre><code class=\"language-Dockerfile\">FROM redis:latest\nCOPY redis.conf /usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf\nCMD [ \"redis-server\", \"/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf\" ]\n</code></pre><p>This Dockerfile sets the base image to the latest version of Redis, copies our Redis configuration file into the image, and sets the CMD to start Redis with the configuration file.</p><p>Build the Docker image by running the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ docker build -t my-redis-image .</code></pre><h2 id=\"step-3-create-a-redis-service\">Step 3: Create a Redis Service</h2><p>Now that we have our Redis Docker image, it's time to create a Kubernetes Service that will expose Redis to the rest of the cluster.</p><p>Create a file named <code>redis-service.yaml</code> with the following contents:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: redis\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: redis\n  ports:\n  - name: redis\n    port: 6379\n\t</code></pre><p>This Kubernetes Service will expose port 6379, which is the default port used by Redis.</p><p>Create the Service by running the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ kubectl apply -f redis-service.yaml</code></pre><h2 id=\"step-4-create-a-persistent-volume-claim-pvc\">Step 4: Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)</h2><p>To store Redis data on Kubernetes, we need to create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) that will be used by the Redis StatefulSet. A PVC requests a specific amount of storage from the Kubernetes cluster, which will be dynamically provisioned by a StorageClass.</p><p>Create a file named <code>redis-pvc.yaml</code> with the following contents:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: redis-pvc\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n  - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n</code></pre><p>This YAML file defines a PVC named <code>redis-pvc</code> with a request for 1GB of storage. We are requesting the <code>ReadWriteOnce</code> access mode, which means that the PVC can be mounted as read-write by a single node at a time.</p><p>To create the PVC, run the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ kubectl apply -f redis-pvc.yaml\n</code></pre><p>Verify that the PVC is created by running the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ kubectl get pvc</code></pre><p>You should see an output similar to the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">NAME        STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE\nredis-pvc   Bound    pvc-8d7d420b-c4a4-4c4b-8b84-2ce4e0b7c1b1   1Gi        RWO            standard       10s\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"step-5-create-a-redis-statefulset\">Step 5: Create a Redis StatefulSet</h2><p>Now that we have our Redis Docker image and Kubernetes Service, it's time to create the Redis StatefulSet.</p><p>Create a file named <code>redis-statefulset.yaml</code> with the following contents:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: StatefulSet\nmetadata:\n  name: redis\nspec:\n  serviceName: redis\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: redis\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: redis\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: redis\n        image: my-redis-image\n        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 6379\n          name: redis\n\t  volumes:\n      - name: redis-data\n      \tpersistentVOlumeClaim:\n        claimName: redis-pvc\n  volumeClaimTemplates:\n  - metadata:\n      name: redis-pvc\n    spec:\n      accessModes: [ \"ReadWriteOnce\" ]\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          storage: 1Gi\n</code></pre><p>This StatefulSet specifies that we want to run three replicas of Redis and that we want to use the Redis Service that we created earlier. It also specifies that we want to use the <code>my-redis-image</code> Docker image that we built earlier.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ kubectl apply -f redis-statefulset.yaml</code></pre><h2 id=\"connecting-to-the-redis-cluster-and-adding-data\">Connecting to the Redis Cluster and Adding Data</h2><p>Now that we have our Redis deployment running let's connect to the cluster and add some data.</p><p>To connect to the Redis cluster, we first need to find the IP address of one of the pods. We can do this by running the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ kubectl get pods -l app=redis</code></pre><p>This will list all of the Redis pods and their status. Copy the name of one of the pods and use it in the following command to get its IP address:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ kubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt; | grep IP:</code></pre><p>Replace <code>&lt;pod-name&gt;</code> with the name of the Redis pod you want to connect to. This will output the IP address of the pod.</p><p>Next, we need to install the Redis command-line interface (CLI) on our local machine. You can do this by running the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ sudo apt-get install redis-tools</code></pre><p>or on Arch Linux</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ sudo pacman -S redis</code></pre><p>Once the Redis CLI is installed, we can connect to the Redis cluster by running the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ redis-cli -h &lt;redis-ip&gt; -p 6379</code></pre><p>Replace <code>&lt;redis-ip&gt;</code> with the IP address of the Redis pod you want to connect to.</p><p>Once you're connected to the Redis cluster, you can add some data by running Redis commands. For example, you can set a key-value pair by running the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-redis\">set mykey myvalue</code></pre><p>You can then retrieve the value of the key by running the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-redis\">get mykey</code></pre><p>This will output the value of the key, which should be <code>myvalue</code>.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>In this blog post, we've gone through the steps necessary to deploy Redis on Kubernetes using StatefulSets. We started by setting up a Kubernetes cluster on our local machine and creating a PresistentVolumeClaim to store Redis data. We then created a StatefulSet definition to deploy multiple Redis pods, each with its own unique hostname and persistent storage.</p><p>Finally, we verified that our deployment was successful by connecting to the Redis cluster and adding some data.</p><p>Using StatefulSets to deploy stateful applications like Redis on Kubernetes provides many benefits. It allows us to easily scale our application horizontally while maintaining data consistency and durability. It also simplifies the deployment process by abstracting away the details of managing stateful pods. With this knowledge, you should be able to deploy Redis on Kubernetes and other stateful applications using StatefulSets with confidence.</p><h2 id=\"further-reading\">Further Reading</h2><p>If you're interested in learning more about Kubernetes and stateful applications, here are some additional resources you may find useful:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/\">Kubernetes Documentation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://redis.io/documentation\">Redis Documentation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/\">Kubernetes StatefulSets</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/articles/kubernetes-stateful-applications/\">Managing Stateful Applications with Kubernetes</a></li><li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/\">Kubernetes Networking: Understanding Service Networking</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"references\">References</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\">Kubernetes</a></li><li><a href=\"https://redis.io/\">Redis</a></li></ul><p>Thank you for following along with me, and happy deploying!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>As someone who carries a gaming laptop around with Linux in it, I often come across laptop users who are constantly on the lookout for lightweight applications that won't drain their batteries too quickly. These users are frequently on the move and can't always access power outlets for long periods of time, so power consumption is a top priority for them. However, many Linux desktop environments don't prioritise power efficiency, leaving laptop users feeling frustrated and searching for better options. I often hear from laptop users who are constantly searching for lightweight applications that won't drain their batteries too quickly. These users are often on the go and don't have access to power outlets for extended periods of time, which makes power consumption a top priority. While there are some great lightweight options out there, many Linux desktop environments are not designed with power efficiency in mind, which can leave laptop users feeling frustrated and in search of better solutions.</p><h2 id=\"why-linux-laptop-users-crave-lightweight-applications\">Why Linux Laptop Users Crave Lightweight Applications</h2><p>The desire for lightweight applications among Linux laptop users is fuelled by the need to optimise battery life. Running resource-intensive applications can quickly deplete a laptop's battery, which can be detrimental for users who rely on their devices while on the move. This is why many users opt for minimalist applications like lightweight text editors and web browsers that are designed to consume less power.</p><p>While these lightweight applications can certainly help to extend battery life on Linux laptops, they may not always provide the most efficient or feature-rich options. Some users find themselves sacrificing functionality and convenience in exchange for a few extra minutes of battery life. This is where lightweight window managers like AwesomeWM or DWM can come in handy.</p><h2 id=\"the-advantages-of-lightweight-window-managers\">The Advantages of Lightweight Window Managers</h2><p>Lightweight window managers are designed to consume fewer system resources than traditional desktop environments like GNOME or KDE. This means that they can provide an efficient and responsive computing experience, even on older or less powerful hardware. They are also highly customisable, making them a favourite among power users who want complete control over their computing experience.</p><p>However, it's important to note that lightweight window managers are not for everyone. They require more technical knowledge to set up and configure than traditional desktop environments, which can be a barrier to entry for some users. Additionally, they may not offer the same level of out-of-the-box functionality and ease of use that many users have come to expect from modern desktop environments.</p><h2 id=\"choosing-the-right-desktop-environment-for-your-needs\">Choosing the Right Desktop Environment for Your Needs</h2><p>For laptop users who prioritise both power and efficiency, a lightweight window manager like AwesomeWM or DWM may be the best choice. These window managers are designed with low power consumption in mind and can provide an efficient and customisable computing experience that can help to extend battery life.</p><p>In conclusion, while lightweight applications can certainly help to extend battery life on Linux laptops, developers need to prioritise power efficiency when designing desktop environments. Lightweight window managers like AwesomeWM and DWM are great options for users who prioritise both power and efficiency, but they may not be the best choice for everyone. Ultimately, the choice of desktop environment or window manager will depend on a user's individual needs and preferences.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>As a tech enthusiast and software developer, I'm always on the lookout for new tools and technologies that can help me become more productive and efficient in my work. Recently, I made the switch from Neovim to Doom Emacs, and I have to say, I've been blown away by what I've found.</p><p>For those not familiar, Vim and Emacs are both powerful text editors that have been around for decades. Vim is known for its speed and simplicity, while Emacs is known for its flexibility and extensibility. There's a never-ending debate about which one is better, and I've seen my fair share of internet memes about it.</p><p>But with Doom Emacs, I get the best of both worlds. I get the speed and simplicity of Vim, along with the flexibility and customisation of Emacs. It's been a bit of a learning curve, but it's been well worth it.</p><p>One of the things that have really impressed me about Emacs is its integration with org-mode. Org-mode is a powerful tool that enables you to create and manage notes, to-do lists, and projects all in one place. It's incredibly flexible and customisable, and can be used for everything from writing articles to managing your personal life.</p><p>But what sets org-mode apart is org-roam, a package that adds a graph database to org-mode. With org-roam, you can easily create links between your notes and connect them to a network of ideas. This allows you to navigate your notes quickly, find related information, and build new insights.</p><p>I've been using org-mode and org-roam for a few weeks now, and it's completely transformed the way I work. I no longer have to keep track of notes and to-do lists in multiple places, and everything is in one centralised location. And with org-roam, I can quickly find related information and make connections between my notes.</p><p>In fact, I'm so impressed with org-mode and org-roam that I've decided to start using it for all my writing and note-taking needs. This means that my future blog posts will mostly be scheduled and written using org-mode.</p><p>Now, I know that switching from Neovim to Doom Emacs might not be for everyone. But if you're looking for a powerful and flexible tool to help you manage your notes and ideas, I highly recommend checking out Doom Emacs and giving org-mode a try. Who knows, it might just change the way you work too!</p><p>In conclusion, as someone who's always looking to improve their workflow, making the switch to Doom Emacs and discovering org-mode and org-roam has been a game-changer for me. I'm excited to see where this new journey takes me, and I can't wait to share my experiences with you in future blog posts written with org-mode.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It is just like yesterday that I saw you, FaceTime with you, had hugged you. All of a sudden, you are not there anymore. There are no such explanations that can help me to express how I felt about this whole situation. Even though, deep in our minds, we already know this probably will happen. I thought I was ready to accept the truth, but somehow, something still broke, shattered, turned into sand and spread inside my heart.</p><h2 id=\"the-stages-of-grief\">The stages of grief</h2><p>I started to look for any substance that could help me numb everything. But I am not sure I am broken. Whisky? Give me that. Wine? I can have it like drinking OJ. The funny thing is more fucked up I was, the soberer I became the following day. This kind of forces me to face the truth, I now officially have no father. I believe he is up somewhere, looking down at me. He was probably smiling that I successfully passed the bar to apply for the scholarship for my Master‚Äôs degree.</p><p>Everyone told me they had a dream about my dad after he passed away, which I had none of. In my culture, loved ones will come to their beloved‚Äôs dream to let them know that he is doing well, to show there is nothing for them to worried about. Since my grandpa passed away, the only one I had a dream of, I never dreamt about anyone else after. Even though I try hard to dream of it, it just doesn‚Äôt work. Probably something with me is horribly wrong. I cannot grieve properly. I do not know if that is a gift or a curse. The only thing I could do was sink myself into booze and hope I felt something.</p><h2 id=\"adjust\">Adjust?</h2><p>He was a rigorous father he was. Yes, he was. Even after I became an adult and started to be in charge of most of my life, he still treated me like I were a kid. I know this is probably the general thing in Asian culture. However, not for these years before. His health conditions are significantly worsening, and he often suffers from pain and insomnia with liver and kidney failure. He becomes numb. Sometimes I don‚Äôt know if he is here or not. There is so much to talk about, but I can put no words into this blog. Right before I went to Australia for my degree, we had a long serious talk about I might not be able to see you after I went back to Taiwan. I still cannot imagine that would open the door, and you are not there cries at me to bring something to you. I hopped on the aeroplane as soon as I submitted my last assignment. It was an overnight flight, and I could not sleep at all. I asked for so much wine to try to fall asleep but failed. All the ceremonies are like a dream. I must detach myself somehow. I cried a little bit. However, that is it. No tears are coming out anymore. If someone says I am very good at moving on, I would not believe you. I am still sad, and I am still heartbroken. I still want to shout and drink myself to half-death. However, life must go on. It does not mean I do not love my father. Even some of the memories are sad and angry. I still love him more than any other person in my life.</p><h2 id=\"i-love-you-every-day-and-now-i-will-miss-you-every-day\">I love you every day. And now I will miss you every day.</h2><p>I love you every day with all my heart. You brought me to this world and food to the table. You make the life I have every single bit of it. You always said that the mother of the family is the centre. For me, you are the one who keeps the family together. Ever since you are gone, this family has been falling apart. No one wants to gather now because you were not there messaging and calling every one of your siblings to come home to grab a bite. You were an essential part of the family. Now things have changed. You always say we have to take care of mom. We will. You are always afraid that mom has no money to live on. We will take care of it. Do not you worried. We got it covered, Dad.</p><p>There is so much more I want to express in this blog post, but so less is being typed here. But life goes on.</p>\n",

Because I never had a chance to finish my draft before I hit the mid-term break.</p><h2 id=\"being-a-student\">Being a student</h2><p>Being a student is fantastic. Let me write down my thoughts about being a student after you work for a few years.</p><p>Usually, people go to work, get off work, go back home and chill for the rest of the day. Maybe have an eat out with friends and family, but that‚Äôs it, some people might choose to read in their free time, but I know most of them are just chilling, stopped.</p><p>Being a student, you don‚Äôt have to worry about anything‚Äîactually, two things to worried about, grades and what is for the next meal. No review nor report is needed by the end of the day, only assignments due at the weekend. Furthermore, the satisfaction of learning new knowledge is unbeatable.</p><h2 id=\"there-is-a-plot-twist\">There is a plot twist</h2><p>However, there is always a but. Studying in a different language could be problematic. In Australia, many second-generation immigrants and international students like me are simultaneously studying in the same major. Communicating has become a significant problem for me. Yet because I learnt most of my English in American English, Aussie / British accents often caught me off guard during the lectures. I have to redo the lecture recording multiple times to understand the whole picture. Luckily I made a few friends who are native Aussie and Singapore. We talk a lot and love each other‚Äôs country, so my listening and pronunciation have improved bit by bit.</p><p>Near the mid-term, when we have to finish multiple assignments for four units, I can have a decent conversation with them with no problem.</p><h2 id=\"mid-term-break\">Mid-term break!</h2><p>Unlike another major, Information of Technology has eight units in the first semester. First, we have to finish four units in five weeks, come with two weeks of ‚Äòmid-term breaks‚Äô and continue with the rest of the four units. So lecture has been compressed from thirteen weeks to just five weeks. It is REALLY intense and challenging for non-native speakers and boarding students like me. Luckily QUT has plenty of resources that can be used, many friendly people and classmates willing to help you, no conditionally. Everyone is helping each other in the class. It‚Äôs night and day compared to what I experienced in my home country.</p><p>After high pressure intense of five weeks, mid-term breaks are here! However, all of my friends are feeling weird, under extreme pressure for five weeks (well, for me, it is more like three weeks), and suddenly, we do not know what to do. So I come back here and restart a couple of my drafts, and because writing is still my weakness when it comes to assignment writing, I need to practice as much as possible during the mid-term breaks.</p><p>I think that‚Äôs the latest update of my journal, and I will see you guys in the next one.</p><p>P.S. Though I know Apple will announce a new model of the MacBook Pro later this year, I still bought a 2021 MacBook Pro last week. It‚Äôs fast, lovely, and a fantastic piece of art with a MagSafe AND HDMI port.</p>\n",

One is starting in July, without EAP, and one is with EAP class and starts in November. The first few days, I‚Äôm just chilling, meeting new friends and having fun. All the good dudes are from my home country, so we get along fairly quickly. I believe it‚Äôs like the fourth day I am in Australia, and a good friend told me that if I take the offer, which starts in November, I would not be able to have the Christmas holiday with my family. Because the mid-term breaks are only a week-long, Taiwan still has the policy to quarantine seven days after entering the country. So, if I go back to Taiwan and spend some quality Christmas with my family, I will have to take the offer starting in July.</p><h2 id=\"uh-oh-ielts\">Uh oh, IELTS</h2><p>It looks like it will be a-okay if I take the offer. However, I didn‚Äôt achieve the IELTS score in the writing section. Which needed to be bend 6; I only had 5.5 at the time. So, either I have to redo the IELTS test within two weeks, or I‚Äôm going to say bye-bye to Christmas. That is not going to happen under my watch, I said to myself. I booked my IELTS test for a week later and‚Ä¶. I failed. I am writing section scores of 5.5 again. From now on, I can almost see the Christmas holiday waving away from me. However, a day after, my agent told me that in QUT, they agreed students have a late enrolment before Week 2. This is huge news for me. Soon enough, I booked my second IELTS test; another 395 AUD was gone; from this point, I had already spent 1185 AUD on IELTS, and I could not fail again.</p><h2 id=\"the-comeback\">The comeback</h2><p>From this point, I did not care about EAP. Moreover, I did not care about EAP teaching me how to write my essay, and multiple friends told me it would be intense if I started my Master of Information Technology a week late. I want to return to Taiwan and spend my Christmas holiday with my family. So, I borrowed some writing notes from my roommates and memorised multiple templates for the writing section. Furthermore, I stopped practising all the sections to focus on my writing. Reading? Nah, Listening? Too Easy. Speaking? I will force myself to go out and have a random convo with some Aussie, and I believe I will be fine. After five days of practising. Results come in on a Thursday morning as text messages; I got 7.5 on Listening, both Reading and Writing are 6, and Speaking with 6.5. I PASS THE BAR.</p><h2 id=\"just-getting-started\">Just getting started</h2><p>Days after, I got my result, just like fast-forwarding. I picked up my results at the IDP the same day I got the text message. After I handed my result to my agent, he told me he would take care of everything else, and 2 hours later, a tuition payment link was sitting inside my mailbox. Paid the bill. Ouch. And going to class on Thursday and Friday, I got my student Id; it‚Äôs happening.</p><h2 id=\"late-enrolment-is-not-good\">Late enrolment is not good.</h2><p>After I paid my tuition fee, everything started to roll. However, it‚Äôs already two weeks gone if you count orientation week. With eight units finished in ten weeks, it‚Äôs going to be like shit hits the fan.</p><p>The first of a few weeks is just trying to catch up with the classes, watching lecture recordings almost every night and at weekends, trying to finish all the tutorial questions and doing assignments simultaneously.</p><p>I just do not have time for anything else. Even my side projects are stopped, along with this blog. Drafts are being updated slowly and no posts are coming out, eventually, I decided to stop doing everything and just focus on my study.</p>\n",

Which is <code>CLI</code> for short, to manage my images and containers. I did have <code>Docker Desktop</code> on my M1 Mac while writing this. To be honest, Even though <code>Graphical User Interface</code>, which is short for <code>GUI</code> is more suitable for modern use. However, most of the <code>GUI</code> application have some draw back such as lack of functionality or UI/UX defects.</p><p>Since such reasons, I generally stay away to almost all GUI for my own sanity, Majority of the time I just feel more comfortable when using <code>CLI</code>.</p><p>Also because of this, I didn‚Äôt get the news that <a href=\"https://www.servethehome.com/docker-abruptly-starts-charging-many-users-for-docker-desktop/\">Docker Abruptly Starts Charging Many Users for Docker Desktop</a>. Which, is knowledgeable but still absurd to witness a company so desperately to make some money from an app that nobody uses. Well, most of the people including me is using it as a daemon to start <code>dockerd</code>.</p><h2 id=\"can-we-run-dockerd-on-macos-docker-desktop-free\">Can We Run <code>dockerd</code> on macOS Docker Desktop-free?</h2><p>Sure we can, thanks to the open source community, we have plenty of options to run Docker Desktop on M1 macOS for free, and there is more. It will not clog up as much resources as Docker Desktop did. You can terminate <code>dockerd</code> anytime you want. Plus, startup time is way faster than Docker Desktop.</p><h2 id=\"simplist-solution\">Simplist Solution.</h2><p>Because I already went that path. So, you don‚Äôt have to go down to that path anymore. After hours of googling and GitHub browsing. I found a project that will achieve all of the requirement that we desire. Fast and Minimalist, it is called <a href=\"https://github.com/abiosoft/colima\">Colima</a>. After simple setup from <a href=\"https://brew.sh\">Home Brew</a> and you are good to go.</p>\n",

Well, at least before I install <a href=\"https://steampowered.com\">Steam</a> on my Linux laptop. Linux gaming is really sky-rocketing when the time I bought my gaming laptop. Thanks to Valve and Proton, gaming on Linux is more and more reliable after the <a href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/steam-deck-hits-over-4000-titles-marked-either-verified-or-playable/\">Steam Deck release</a>. I can enjoy almost every game in my Steam library. When I start to download games I notice there is some random freeze during the download and game installation.</p><p>After some investigation I realise it's most likely because my BTRFS + CryptSetup bottleneck my NVMe performance. However, at the time when I decide which encode I should setup my BTRFS partition, I already done the research that normal usage of I/O will not cause the freeze based on calculations, it should be totally fine. Hence I towards my direction to dirty page.</p><h2 id=\"dirty-page-how-dirty-is-that\">Dirty page, how dirty is that?</h2><p>About how dirty page works, this <a href=\"https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/579781\">StackOverflow</a> answer will describe this much more detail and better than me.</p><p>I'm not going to explain all the technical details about how dirty page works in Linux, but can picture you this. Dirty page is like <code>pagefile</code> in Windows, but instead of create a <code>pagefile.sys</code> inside your <code>C:\\</code>, or like Linux's <code>swapfile</code> sits inside your partition, it put cache into RAM and till the time free pages are all full, Kernel will generate a flusher process to flush the dirty pages. <code>dirty_ratio</code> should be around 20 percents of your total RAM, and <code>dirty_background_ratio</code> should be 10 percents of your total RAM by default. In my case it is around 4.8 G of <code>dirty_background_ratio</code> and 9.6 G of <code>dirty_ratio</code>. This size is based on 48G RAM sits inside my laptop. There is no such of HDD or NVMe drive can handle 4.8G write speed per second, eventually will make Kernel to hang all the process and wait flusher to clean out the dirty pages.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-prevent-io-freeze\">How to prevent I/O freeze</h2><p>First thought is reduct dirty ratio percentage, but you cannot just lower the value and hope it will fix everything. Zero out both <code>dirty_ratio</code> and <code>dirty_background_ratio</code> will simply make your system not usable because Kernel flusher process is constantly writing data to HDD, making system to freeze almost all the time. So the ideal situation is find the perfect value of <code>dirty_background_ratio</code> and <code>dirty_ratio</code> make flusher can process dirty page without hanging all the process on the side. However, I do not know how to accomplish this due to I have no idea how the calculation works with <code>dirty_ratio</code> even after few days of googling around. Moreover, <code>dirty_ratio</code> and <code>dirty_background_ratio</code> will not accept decimal as value, so the lowest value will be around 480Mb (1%) and 960Mb(2%).</p><h2 id=\"percentage-or-bytes\">Percentage or Bytes?</h2><p>From reading <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysctl/vm.html#dirty-background-ratio\">The Linux Kernel documentation</a>, I realise there is an alternative option about <code>dirty_ratio</code> is defined as <code>dirty_bytes</code>. Which means I can limit the dirty page to precise size, which is more reliable in my case. After tried different sizes of <code>dirty_bytes</code> without success, I decide to dig more into various Linux distros. Hopefully I can find one distro has default setting of <code>dirty_bytes</code> but not <code>dirty_ratio</code> instead. </p><h2 id=\"solution-thank-you-random-stranger\">Solution, Thank you random stranger!</h2><p>After awhile I found that Pop!OS Github have a <a href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/default-settings/issues/111\">similar issue</a>. Moreover, there is a pull-request which is using <code>dirty_bytes</code>. I put those values into my <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and system is almost freeze-free! </p><p>However random freeze still happens from time to time when install a game or doing large file transferring, I'm happy for what I get now. If someday I decided to remove <code>cryptsetup</code> from my system and stick to non-encrypt BTRFS (which full wipe is needed), Probably will never get freeze again.</p>\n",

Is to make your phone more reachable for you, help you set your timer or schedule your meeting, or even an event on calendar. More you use them, more you get used to it. This is where the evil plan sneaks in.</p><p>I remember after few months after audio assistance can be active by your voice without touching your phone, some websites start pushing out articles about how phone record your conversations and <em>magically</em> some keywords started to pop out as form of advertisements. After few months more people notice this, they decide to change their methods by adding a confirm page, request your agreement to use your audio data. Shortly after, a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/siri-new-always-on-feature-has-privacy-implications-2015-9\">INSIDER Article</a> reveals the background of this whole operation.</p><h2 id=\"let%E2%80%99s-shoot-out-most-effective-advertisement\">Let‚Äôs shoot out most effective advertisement</h2><blockquote>Surveillance is all about convenience - Bruce Schneier</blockquote><p>Umm, I‚Äôm not sure about that, if I‚Äôm going to let a smartphone listen all my conversation what will be next? You guessed it! Advertisement!</p><p>The final form (well, at least for now) is trying to pinpoint the correct audience, make personalize advertisement more efficient and lower the cost. Nothing is better than pushing out an advertisement about catnip towards people who just had a conversation about their cats. But there must be a way to stop this, right?</p><h2 id=\"how-to-avoid-it\">How to avoid it</h2><p>Most of the articles online now is suggesting you whether turn off your virtual assistance, using a VPN, or keep your software up to date (huh?) to avoid conversations being upload to cloud. Are you sure you want to actually disable Siri or OK google helping you when your both hands are busy? Moreover this VPN thing, it‚Äôs not even an option to avoid these kind of things, companies will still identify you by various ways. However, most the phone now days you can decide to share your audio or not at setup page, simply disable that option will stop the personalize advertisement magically pops out. Or will it?</p><h2 id=\"sorry-there-is-no-sweet-spot-here\">Sorry, there is no sweet spot here</h2><p>Between being listen or not being listen, unfortunately sweet spot of this did not exists (yet), you can not have it all. I tried to disable audio sharing option at the setup page but finds out that I am still, getting pushed by personalized advertisement. Because I am still using various app to <em>Voice Call</em> to my friends. Where those app has requested me allow them to use my microphone. Simply disable core function of the phone is only effective on basis usage. When you allow an app to use your microphone, there will always a leak to share your conversation during using that app. Best way to avoid it is only use FaceTime or regular phone calls and not use any of other voice call app.</p><h2 id=\"what-would-you-think-about-this\">What would you think about this?</h2><p>Being listen? Or rather not?</p><p>I am so used to Siri helps me to start a timer while doing laundry, reminds me return a call 10 minutes later. Even schedule my events and etc... It is too convenience and seamless to a point that when I am at some places can not speak freely, I find myself have trouble to find all the options inside calendar and reminders. I am sure they designed this purposely to make users feel it is easier to set things up by their virtual assistance but not by their own hands. And this is how they make you can not turn virtual assistance off. I guess, surveillance actually is all about convenience.</p>\n",

Yes, <strong>they do filter now</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"so-what-those-features-do\">So... What those features do?</h2><p>If you are normal, not geeky like me. You probably will not understand today‚Äôs article is about. Let me walk you through it.</p><h3 id=\"have-this-ever-happens-to-you\">Have this ever happens to you?</h3><p>One day you were searching some cat nips for your lovely and evil cat. Boom, there is an advertisement pops out after couple of clicks and show you various brands of cat nips you can buy, some of it even have some amazing coupons. That is what trackers does. They track everything you search, by some algorithm they did to your search information and push the advertisement to you.</p><p>They analyze your data and decide which advertisement you should receive, or track your behavior of various search results. That is how search engine service make their benjamins <em>(get it? üòâ)</em>.</p><p>In my company, we put trackers on every links to our ECommerce site. Our marketing team will analyze user behavior to improve user experience, or use the result to decide next target audience. Sounds acceptable right?</p><p>Today, people are more focusing about their digital privacy, tolerance of being track has reach the new low. Simply because people started to think they are being track when on the internet, random advertisement appears after a oral conversation or maybe some inappropriate advertisement shows up at important meetings based on their search results last night. <em>(yes, your phone is listening to everything you said, I will write an article about it later)</em></p><p>People decide to lose those trackers by turning on the browser settings named ‚ÄúSend NoTrack To Websites‚Äù, but guess what? This is not that effective at all. It can be bypassed by various ways.</p><h3 id=\"how-about-filters\">How about filters?</h3><p>Remember the first time you enter porn site? You have to lie about your age. That is what filter basically does, but you do not have the control of whether enter the site by lying your age or not.</p><p>There is <strong>a lot</strong> of politics incorrect websites on the internet (it is kind of fun to visit, though). It can be search by some very simple keywords, but company will not let this happen since it have chance turn into bad influence to public reputations for their investor. What do they do? They filter these kinds of website out of their search result as much as they can.</p><p>According to DuckDuckGo‚Äôs filter bubble is kind of working with trackers, but in more advance way. Think of this, when we both search for bluetooth speakers, your first result is eBay, but I get Amazon, it is based on personal preference which we choose to go the most. DuckDuckGo <strong>promise</strong> there is no filter bubble on their search results. This was the most greatest concept of internet equity of the time.</p><p>At first I didn‚Äôt use DuckDuckGo as much I use Google, because back in around 2015, search results of DuckDuckGo is filled with spam and porn site. I often find myself digging through results by filter those websites. I know there have some progress they have to figure it out, so I still coming back time to time. Results are too, getting better and better. Around 2018, I fully switched to DuckDuckGo, and one day I see this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/di4xd6/duckduckgo_is_censoring_results/\">reddit post</a> from r/privacy on reddit.</p><h2 id=\"censor-and-remove-results\">Censor and Remove results</h2><p>At first it did not bothers me, I honestly do not care about random porn site is being censored, but I put DuckDuckGo to probation. For awhile it does not seems growing, so I did not pay much attention about how DuckDuckGo threats their results. Last month a news comes out titled as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/duck-duck-go-reverses-course-will-demote-russian-propaganda-in-search-results-014336389.html\"> DuckDuckGo will demote Russian propaganda in search results </a>. Okay, this is understandable for me, based on the situation of Ukraine with Russia, this kind of adjustment is reasonable enough to keep public not effective by the... <em>Hold on, this is filtering right?</em></p><p>If you stand your point say something like ‚ÄúIt is not filtering, it just order the result from relative to relative + country!‚Äù. Alright, I am going to let this one slide then, but next one is not bearable at all.</p><h2 id=\"duckduckgo-remove-results-for-major-pirate-site\">DuckDuckGo remove results for major pirate site</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/duckduckgo-removes-pirate-sites-204936242.html\">DuckDuckGo removes search results for major pirate websites</a></p><p>Honestly I was shock when I read this title. I dash to their about page because I <strong>knew</strong> they promised they will not do such thing. This is why I use their service at the first place, and voila, promise is gone.</p><p>At some point, DuckDuckGo give up being uncensored, and not filtered search engine to user privacy focused website. I felt betrayed, after all these years being so loyalty, recommend their service every time I had a chance, this is what they ended up to. A search engine should threat all results equally, no censorship, no filter and everyone should get the same results by their algorithm.</p><h2 id=\"alternative\">Alternative?</h2><p>I do some research after I saw this news, looks like <a href=\"https://brave.com/search/\">Brave</a> launches their own search engine recently. There is some really interesting selling point such as Independent search and Search without a trace. About censorship I‚Äôve seen a <a href=\"https://community.brave.com/t/braves-official-stance-on-censorship/194451\">post</a> on their forum asking but there have not had an official reply for it.</p><p>I will give <a href=\"https://search.brave.com\">Brave</a> a shot and see where it goes.</p><blockquote>The fact is that censorship always defeats its own purpose, for it creates, in the end, the kind of society that is incapable of exercising real discretion, incapable, that is, of doing an honest or intelligent job, and thus guarantees a steady intellectual decline... - Henry Steele Commager</blockquote>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>If you follows all kinds of technology news every day like me, you must have notice this NFT is bursting everywhere. I believe even at this time there is a lot of people who don't understand what NFT is and why everyone on the Internet is throwing money into it.</p><p>Basically, you can think NFT is like a digital identity of an object. Currently, most of the object put on NFT is art, painting, and weird avatar pictures. From my perspective NFT is toward the correct way of internet evolving, but there is some major problem with it.</p><h2 id=\"technology-is-not-there-yet\">Technology is not there yet</h2><p>From my point if view, the current state of NFT is not in the production situation yet. If you are already pissed off by seeing this just bear with me. Let me explain.</p><p>If you buy an art online or at the auction, got someone to deliver to your door, you can not ever trust anyone, but the professional tells you the art you bought is legit. With NFT you <strong>sure</strong> your purchases are automatically verified as the only authentic object in the world, but why?</p><h2 id=\"non-fungible-token-or-nft-for-short\">Non-Fungible Token or NFT for short</h2><p>Long story short, besides all the tech details, I can explain this fairly quickly. Back in your childhood, you must have collected some baseball cards, Pok√©mon cards or basketball cards. You trade your cards to other kids to get your favorite cards. It is just like that. You can see this as trading cards, but here is the catch, each card have one and only copy that is legit, rest of it just like random china made low quality cards. If you purchase a Non-Fungible Token or NFT, you are the only one who owns the legit copy of the item.</p><p><em>It is basically like card trading on steroids.</em></p><h2 id=\"the-actually-catch\">The Actually Catch</h2><p>Just like how card trade ends, the game ends when the hype is over. If no one is interested with NFT anymore, you are stuck with it forever. Well, if you really like the NFT you bought, good for you, but for most of the collectors in the market right now, they <strong>need</strong> the hype to keep this game rolling. So they can continuously flip the price over and over again. Did not this sound familiar? You are right.</p><blockquote>A Musical Chair game, but last one lose.</blockquote><h2 id=\"should-you-stay-away-for-now\">Should you stay away for now?</h2><p>I‚Äôll say it depends, if you see something really catches your eyes and the price is right, I will say go get it, support the author. As this point, the technology is not there for more than just a trading game, but there is <strong>a lot</strong> of potential with this. I‚Äôm waiting for NFT can do more than just a decoration for your digital room or some item in the digital game or social media avatar, but actually have some connection to the real world.</p><h2 id=\"real-world-scenario\">Real World Scenario</h2><p>I‚Äôm willing to see in the near future, every object binds with NFT. When you purchase a car, only you can start the engine of the car since you‚Äôre the only one have NFT binds with the car, or enter an apartment binds with a NFT you own. People can share their account <em>(or wallet address)</em> to trusted users for access the object. That is when I recommend to dive in.</p><p>For now, NFT is digital art market, non of the items you bought is connecting to the real world. You can try to play it a bit, but if you trying to flip your money with it, just remember to be careful.</p>\n",

It supposed to sign my request to the APIs. Which need to do something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Stream stream = new MemoryStream(certificate.Value.Export(X509ContentType.Pkcs12 , certPwd.ToCharArray()));\nPkcs12Store store = new(stream, certPwd.ToCharArray());\nstring pName = default;\nforeach (string n in store.Aliases)\n{\n    if (store.IsKeyEntry(n))\n    {\n        pName = n;\n        Console.WriteLine(n);\n    }\n}\nConsole.WriteLine(store.GetKey(pName).Key);\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, it needs to store the certificate into <code>Pkcs12Store</code> which can only be created by using <code>Stream</code>. when <code>X509ContentType</code> is not defined when download the certificate, it will not allow you to do such thing. To solve this we need to add <code>X509ContentType.Exportable</code> into certificate's <code>X509StorageFlags</code>.</p>\n<p>First I tried to add <code>X509StorageFlags</code> to <code>X509Certificate2</code> <strong>After</strong> it's being downloaded, sadly it will not work this way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-solution\">The solution</h2>\n<p>After digging awhile I figure out <code>DownloadCertificateAsync</code> comes with an option called <code>DownloadCertificateOptions</code>. Which you can define <code>X509StorageFlags</code> before download the certificate. After a little bit modification, my code become like this:</p>\n<pre><code>DownloadCertificateOptions downloadOption = new(certificateName)\n{\n    KeyStorageFlags = X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet |\n        X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable\n};\nvar certificate = await client.DownloadCertificateAsync(downloadOption);\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this modification, certificate can be exported with <code>Pkcs12</code> format and convert it to <code>AsymmetricKeyParameter</code> without any problem.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->\n",

				"content_text": "<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I've been reading news differently from normal person, for years I've been using <a href=\"https://reddit.com\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://9gag.com\">9GAG</a> for latest information, use controversial memes to puzzle the news. I often get distract, it's difficult to scroll through same series of memes at one time. Thus, I found myself end up scrolling random memes and forgot what I was looking for. Hense, I try to build my news reading habits more efficiently. Tried couple of RSS readers or even self-host it, but it seems too hard for me to check readers at the end of the day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"atomic-habits-come-to-rescue\">Atomic Habits come to rescue</h2>\n<p>Couple of days ago I got recommanded to read this book Atomic Habits, I look this book up on my Kobo reader and bought it. This book shows how to make a habit irresistible by combining your normal tasks with some habit you want to build. Such as you want to start a jogging habits, but you find yourself hard to do it. You can either jogging when you're walking your dog, or go for a run in the morning right before you pick up your mail. I do check my work email daily basis, how about put these two together? If I'm able to build a habit to read the newsletters after I checked my work email, I won't find myself scrolling random memes at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>The Idea of combining different tasks to achieve build a new habit is the idea of this post title.</p>\n<h2 id=\"emails-and-news-hmm\">Emails and News, hmm.</h2>\n<p>Back in the day we used to subscribe to various newspapers / magazines and receive latest news everyday morning from your porch. Then the Internet kicks in hard. Newspapers and magazines are turn into digital form, people tend to check on their favorite websites for news. It become massively chaos lately because fake news are plaguing the news enviornment for traffic and advertisement. If you want to verify the article you see is legit you will have to go on various big media websites and trying to dig out the similar title from their lack of UI/UX websites. Some of them does not have a search box for it.</p>\n<p>Thus an idea of reading news from email is pop in my head. Don't get me wrong, email subscription exists from the day internet is being form. Sadly it's too easy to retrieve email list from random people and just spam the useless information to someone's mailbox. All the paradox / scam / controversal letters piling up email service storage. Let's face it, the shape of email ecosystem is bad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lets-do-it-with-new-mailbox\">Let's do it with new mailbox.</h2>\n<p>It is HARD to clean your personal mailbox. Most of websites won't ask you if you want to subscribe their eDM when you registering, some of them even sends you email regardlessly even they <strong>promise they won't spam</strong>. All kinds of email from Amazon, Twitter and Facebook and even some random websites you never visits are already occupied your mailbox. It's too hard to unsubscribe each one of them and delete all those non-important email, while carefully avoid the email that you want to preserve at the same time.</p>\n<p>Luckly register a new email account is fairaly easy, so I use my iCloud email alternative mailbox just for reciving news letters from various websites I tend to read. After awhile of enjoyment, disaster crawls back.</p>\n<p>My newly created news only mailbox is filling up with random emails again! Somehow email junkies are able to retrieve my email from some website and start spaming my news mailbox and the source is spreading. Till the time I found out, my mailbox is already subscribe dozens of website. I have no clue that which website is giving my email out.</p>\n<p>So I deleted my news mailbox, created another mailbox and subscribe only the majour media company, same thing happens again. The lack of trust of those media company already up to the point that I can't stand it anymore. Eventually I abandoned this idea for awhile.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hop-on-morning-brew\">Hop on Morning Brew</h2>\n<p>It's a Wednesday afternoon, I was browsing random videos on YouTube and this dude have sponsership from a company called <a href=\"https://www.morningbrew.com\">Morning Brew</a>. Suspose this company combine daily digest and latest news, fits it inside an email. I look it up a bit and found out this company is already exists for 25+ years. I went to their website and read some of their latest articles, it's really good that they shrink the most content out but still preserve the correct information, most importantly, <strong>no click bait</strong>.<br>\nShortly after I subscribe their email news letters and I never look back.</p>\n<p>MorningBrew did a great job by collecting all the information, and shink the content to not too long that you have to sit down and read, but fits for taking a bus or subway to work, or waiting in line for your morning coffee at your coffee shop.</p>\n<p>After a few days of trying their service I found out they have more subject focued categories. I also subscribe their <a href=\"https://www.morningbrew.com/sidekick\">Sidekick</a> for life management and productivity hacks, <a href=\"https://www.emergingtechbrew.com\">Emerging Tech Brew</a> for most latest tech newsletters, and <a href=\"https://www.morningbrew.com/money-scoop\">Money Scoop</a> for personal finance newsletters. Only Morning Brew comes into your mailbox daily, Sidekick, Money Scoop and Emerging Tech Brew are twice-weekly. All Morning Brew's emails are in similar layout, easy to read and have links to the topic that you want to dig in more about. The overall reading experience are pleasant.</p>\n<p>I'd like to recommand to everyone who want to save time from browsing all types of media websites. If you find yourself lost in different topic as you tended to, and find yourself diffcult to find the legit information, give Morning Brew a shot, I bet you won't regret it. And they truly won't spam your mailbox.</p>\n<h2 id=\"referral-links\">Referral Links</h2>\n<p>Here is the referral links from morning brew. By clicking this link it won't do anything else but records how many people I introduce to their services, as some rewards I could get some cute stickers!<br>\nYou can find your referral links inside your Morning Brew emails and spread it to your families and friends too.<br>\nIt is much appreciated if you decide to use my links for the first time you hop in :)</p>\n<p>For daily news digest:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/r/?kid=3448b2f4\">Morning Brew</a><br>\nFor life management:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.morningbrew.com/sidekick/r?kid=3448b2f4\">Side Kick</a><br>\nFor finance:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.morningbrew.com/money-scoop/r?kid=3448b2f4\">Money Scoop</a><br>\nFor tech:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/r?kid=3448b2f4\">Emerging Tech Brew</a></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->\n",

Which you are reading it right now.\n<ul>\n<li>I ended up going back to Ghost, just because it's the most painless thing to work with docker, it just works.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, the list is finished, so let's get right to it.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->\n",

The idea of using blockchain to deliver message is paradox, it is good to be fully anonymous when you trying to say something on the internet. However, this concept can also be easily adopt by criminals. Overall I think even though Bitmessage have come so far, there is still a long way to go.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->About Bitmessage&rsquo;s POW (Proof-of-Work) even at this point writing this article, I have not figure it out how this system worked. I tried to browse someone elses code on send message part they are not using that method too. At first I did not think my bot will be working without doing POW before message sending out, but I do get some replies from Chans that complaining the dummy message I sent. Hence I guess this worked. :P<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

So I download it back to my laptop to see what has changed since. If you are not familar with BitMessage, it is a really cool application lives on blockchain, you can find more useful and accurate information on their <a href=\"https://wiki.bitmessage.org/\">wiki</a> page.</p><p>After surfing around their Github I found that they have API built into client allows other program to communicate with the client. So, why not try to spam this specific protocol to see what blockchain can prevent with spam bot?</p><h2 id=\"lets-spam-it\">Let's Spam It!</h2><h3 id=\"environment\">Environment</h3><p>First, we are going to use <a href=\"https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage/releases/\">PyBitmessage</a> to be our API Proxy. Basically it runs on all platforms because of Python + QT, pick whatever operation system you have and let's roll!</p><p>First of all we need to open our newly downloaded Bitmessage client and let it sync through the data. Sync is finished if you sees <code>Object(s) to be synced = 0</code>, next we need to retrieve <code>keys.dat</code>. Normally <code>keys.dat</code> is bundled within the application. Go to <code>Settings</code> -&gt; <code>Settings</code> and check the <code>Run in Portable Mode</code>. After you close the application, <code>keys.dat</code> should appear inside the folder.</p><h3 id=\"enable-api-proxy\">Enable API Proxy</h3><p>Use your favorite editor to open <code>keys.dat</code>, add following information.</p><pre><code class=\"language-conf\">apiport = 8442\napiinterface = 127.0.0.1\napiuseranme = &lt;desireusername&gt;\napipassword = &lt;desirepassword&gt;</code></pre><p>After that, open Bitmessage again and uncheck the <code>Run in Portable Mode</code>, you can let it keep running in the background.</p><h2 id=\"the-making-of-spam-bot\">The Making of Spam Bot</h2><p>Bitmessage API is using <code>xmlrpc</code> to communicate according to API docs. We can use simple Python console to test the connection.</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">apiUri = \"http://username:password@127.0.0.1:8442\"\napi = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(apiUri)\n</code></pre><p>After connection is established you can use simple <code>add</code> method to check if client can start handle requests.</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; api.add(2,3)\n5\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre><h3 id=\"retrieve-chan-addresses\">Retrieve Chan Addresses</h3><p>To make the spam bot have most converages of users, target to Chans is the best idea. First we need to retrieve all address which I pre-added to Bitmessage. Example code will be something like below</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import xmlrpclib\nimport json\n\ndef get_address():\n    client_address = json.loads(api.listAddresses())\n    target_address = []\n    y = 0\n    \n    for x in client_address['addresses']:\n        target_address.append(client_address['addresses][y]['address'].encode('ASCII', 'ignore'))\n        y += 1\n        \n    return target_address\n\nif __main__ == \"__name__\":\n\tapiUri = \"http://username:password@127.0.0.1:8442\"\n\tapi = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(apiUri)\n\tprint get_address()</code></pre><p>After can printed all the addresses, we need to work on the spam part.</p><h3 id=\"send-message\">Send Message</h3><p>On <a href=\"https://bitmessage.org/wiki/API_Reference\">official API docs</a> send message through API is fairly easy, encode desire message to <code>base64</code> and you are able to send the request to API. However, this is not a good spam bot, it require to modify hardcoded message in order to spam a new message. Proper spam bot is needed to edit message on the fly while program is running, so we need to make a text file to store messages. I make a <code>content.txt</code> to store spam message.</p><pre><code>This is title, I'm going to spam message.\nThis is the message body</code></pre><p>In order to read this file, we need to write a new method.</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">def send_message():\n\twith open('content.txt', 'r+') as f:\n    con = f.read().split('\\n', 1)\n    subject = con[0]\n    content = con[1]\n    subject = subject.encode('utf-8').strip()\n    subject_data = base64.b64encode(subject)\n    content = content.encode('utf-8').strip()\n    content_data = base64.b64encode(content)\n    \n    while True:\n    \tfor j in addrs:\n        \tack_data = api.sendMessage(j, j, subject_data, content_data, 2)\n            print 'Sent:', ackData\n            time.sleep(2)\n        print 'All address are looped, sleep 3600 seconds.'\n        time.sleep(3600)\n    return</code></pre><p>And now you have your simple spam bot.</p><h3 id=\"polish-the-code\">Polish the Code</h3><p>Since the end game is distribute to cross-platform, we need to make our little spam bot able to self-generate config file and content text file. </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import os\nimport sys\nfrom os import path, environ\n\ndef get_config_folder():\n\tapp_folder = \"PyBitmessage\"\n    data_folder = None\n    if \"BITMESSAGE_HOME\" in environ:\n    \tdata_fonder = environ[\"BITMESSAGE_HOME\"]\n        if data_fonder[-1] not in [os.path.sep, os.path.altsep]:\n        \tdata_folder += os.path.sep\n    elif sys.platform == 'darwin':\n    \tif \"HOME\" in environ:\n        \tdata_folder = path.join(os.environ[\"HOME\"], \"Library/Application Support/\", app_folder) + '/'\n    elif sys.platform == 'win32':\n    \tdata_folder = path.join(environ[\"APPDATA\"].decode(sys.getfilesystemencoding(), 'ignore'), app_folder) + path.sep\n    else:\n    \ttry:\n        \tdata_folder = path.join(environ[\"XDG_CONFIG_HOME\"], app_folder)\n        except KeyError:\n        \tdata_folder = path.join(environ[\"HOME\"], \".config\", app_folder)\n            \n    return data_folder</code></pre><p>Using method above we can retrieve <code>keys.dat</code> from almost every platforms. Then we need to retrieve api config from it. To be noted <code>keys.dat</code> have same format of <code>ConfigParser</code>. After little copy and paste, result should somewhat like this.</p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">import os\nimport sys\nfrom os import path, environ\n\ndef get_config_folder():\n\tapp_folder = \"PyBitmessage\"\n    data_folder = None\n    if \"BITMESSAGE_HOME\" in environ:\n    \tdata_fonder = environ[\"BITMESSAGE_HOME\"]\n        if data_fonder[-1] not in [os.path.sep, os.path.altsep]:\n        \tdata_folder += os.path.sep\n    elif sys.platform == 'darwin':\n    \tif \"HOME\" in environ:\n        \tdata_folder = path.join(os.environ[\"HOME\"], \"Library/Application Support/\", app_folder) + '/'\n    elif sys.platform == 'win32':\n    \tdata_folder = path.join(environ[\"APPDATA\"].decode(sys.getfilesystemencoding(), 'ignore'), app_folder) + path.sep\n    else:\n    \ttry:\n        \tdata_folder = path.join(environ[\"XDG_CONFIG_HOME\"], app_folder)\n        except KeyError:\n        \tdata_folder = path.join(environ[\"HOME\"], \".config\", app_folder)\n            \n    return data_folder\n\ndef get_bm_config(setting_key):\n\tvalue = None\n    try:\n    \tvalue = cp.get(settings_section, setting_key)\n    except Exception as e:\n    \tpass\n    return value\n\nif __main__ == \"__name__\":\n\tcp = ConfigParser.SafeConfigParser()\n    cp.read(get_config_fonder() + 'keys.dat')</code></pre><p>After combine both config retrieve and send message code, this spam bot is ready for production.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>I have made couple of spam bots, basically all bots does the same thing, same concept. The idea of using blockchain to deliver message is paradox, it is good to be fully anonymous when you trying to say something on the internet. However, this concept can also be easily adopt by criminals. Overall I think even though Bitmessage have come so far, there is still a long way to go.</p><p>About Bitmessage's POW (Proof-of-Work) even at this point writing this article, I have not figure it out how this system worked. I tried to browse someone elses code on send message part they are not using that method too. At first I did not think my bot will be working without doing POW before message sending out, but I do get some replies from Chans that complaining the dummy message I sent. Hence I guess this worked. :P</p>\n",
